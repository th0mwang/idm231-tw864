                Fire-type moves are based on attacks of fire itself, and most of them can leave the status Burn. Fire types are also immune to being Burned, regardless of the type of move used that would have inflicted a Burn.
                
                Fire Pokémon have notably fewer species compared to the other Starter types, due to a lack of natural phenomena that can be described as fire</p3>
